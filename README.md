# BBGE
Bases Between Given Exponents (BBGE) is an esoteric, non-Turing complete language dedicated to printing the results of problems of the nature: “Output all bases between these bounds for which the product of raising the base(s) to a given exponent is also a whole number for which another base can be raised to a second exponent”.
